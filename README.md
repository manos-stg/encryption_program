# encryption_program
I am new to python. This is a program that allows you to encrypt and translate text using a specific encryption method.

> If you choose to encrypt text, it takes a given text and converts it into a binary representation based on a predefined dictionary of characters. The resulting encrypted text is then displayed.

> If you choose to translate encrypted text, it takes the encrypted text and converts it back into the original text based on the binary representation and the dictionary.

> The program also provides information on the limitations of the encryption method, such as the allowed characters that can be encrypted or translated.
